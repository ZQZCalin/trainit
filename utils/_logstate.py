'''
plumbing log (or other) data through a jax.jit is a huge pain
This is intended to make it a bit easier.

The typical setup is that you have some kind of train_step function that takes as input
a train_state pytree (or more than one train_state pytree) containing model parameters, optimizer
state etc.
Then train_step returns a new train_state pytree.

Your problem is that you might want to log some data from inside the model or optimizer. Normally,
you would return this data as part  of the train_state pytree. But where is it in the pytree?
In order to actually do the logging, you'd need to have some monstrosity like

log_data(train_state.model.trunk.layers[2].transformer.attention.activations_to_log)

Worse, if your model architecture changes slightly, you might have to go back and 
change all these log  calls.

Instead, we'll introduce a simple way to get around this:
any data that you'll want to log, you should wrap in a Log class defined here.
There's nothing fancy about the Log class, it's literally just a pytree-compatible lable for
the given node.

Then, after returning the pytree, you can functions like:
map_logs(func, train_state) to apply func to all the values in train_state that were wrapped in Log
    objects (map_logs will unwrap them for you)
list_logs(train_state) to get a list of all the (unwrapped) objects that were wrapped as logs.

So, you could do
map_logs(log_data, train_state)
to automatically call log_data on all the log stuff.
